📌 Project Overview
This project is a frontend assignment provided by [SimplePlan Media] as part of the internship selection process.
The task was to convert the provided Figma UI design into a fully responsive HTML & CSS implementation while using the supplied fonts and assets.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Responsive Design
- Custom Fonts (@font-face)
- Figma (for reference)

🎨 Design Implementation
I followed the Figma design closely and implemented the following major sections:

- Hero Section
- Our Blogs
- Love From Community
- Meet Our Teachers
- Footer Section
- Header / Navigation Bar

The fonts provided (primaryBold, secondary) were imported using @font-face, and all color variables were used from the supplied color palette.

⚠️ Note
Due to limited available time, a few minor design elements and refinements could not be fully implemented.
However, the major UI sections and visuals closely match the Figma design, and the structure is complete and functional.

I'm happy to make further improvements if needed.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Download or clone the project files.
Open index.html in any web browser.
Make sure the folder structure remains the same so fonts & images load correctly.
